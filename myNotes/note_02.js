3; Moment.js is js library commonly used for handling date and time manipulation in JavaScript. It provides functionalities such as parsing, validating, manipulating, and formatting dates and times.

4; Static vs Dynamic Typing
Static vs. Dynamic defines how a language expects you to declare data types. Static typed languages require explicit definition of a data type when they create a piece of data (e.g. variable, parameter, return value). Dynamic languages are the opposite and can infer, or at least try to guess, the type that we're using.

6; Git comments =
git add .
git commit -m "comment"
git push origin or master

git status
git reset --hard => (discards last changes)
git log --oneline => shows git commits
git commit --amend => is used in Git to modify the most recent commit (not yet pushed one only)

HTTP Requests: On the internet, your web browser sends requests to servers when you visit websites. These requests ask for specific information, like a webpage or data.

Why Express: Express is a toolbox for building web applications in JavaScript. It provides tools and rules to handle requests and send responses. Express makes managing interactions, like viewing webpages or using app features, easier.

Creating an Express App: Writing const app = express(); means "Let's create a web app using Express." Think of app as our workspace for building the website or app.

HTTP Methods: These are actions for requests. For instance, GET gets information from a server, while POST adds data to a server.

Routing: In Express, we use routes to direct requests to different parts of our app. If someone asks for /about, we show them info about our website using routes.

Middleware: Middleware acts like a filter for requests, performing actions before they reach their final destination. It's useful for tasks like checking if a user is logged in or logging request info.

/* 





Notes
- Browser only accepts get, not update or delete methods. 
- get only used for providing pages, while post is used for creating or updating data.
- We mostly use get and post from postman:  
    -get(requesting data from database), 
    -post(creating, delete). This is most common case in many companies.

// nested rooting - creating roots inside roots

// Lesson 66- ordersPage

// -Publishing ordersPage screen components and sectional components.

// Accordion (mui)
// The Accordion component lets users show and hide sections of related content on a page.

// Lesson 66- ordersPage
// member - signup, login process and Token Authentication

// SSR: The server generates and sends a ready HTML file to the users.
// SPA: The server sends minimal HTML and JavaScript files. The React (or other frameworks) in the browser fetches data (usually in JSON format) from APIs and dynamically generates the HTML.

// Authentication Process
// 1. Sessions(using Cookies)
// 2. Tokens (using Cookies)
// 3. Tokens (using Headers)


// Cookie parser => Used to save tokens in cookies so they can persist in the browser after user login, allowing the token to travel with the browser for subsequent requests. It acts as middleware.

Aggregation framework is used to perform operations such as filtering, sorting, grouping...
Aggregation pipeline has stages. 
  - it has 1 array arg. cos it executes its so called 'methods' consequently and in the end it deals with db once
// order of execution is so important
// Aggregation pipeline has only one argument which is a list.
// Lookup. We used lookup inside aggregation to show ordered items to the user on order-page

TODO:  Param-Query types,  how to call
Query 
const  query = req.query;
console.log("query", query);
postman. localhost:3003/product/all?name=david&age=28

Param
postman. localhost:3003/product/all/david
router.ts "/product/all/:id"
GET only has Headers (sending data to backend through url in postman)
main difference is query is after ? symbol. 

GET method can do all job POST does, but this is not preferable
get => retrieve data
post => mutate data

shaping in ts => introducing such data has such type

async & await
  - async declares this is async function and always returns a promise. 
  - await pauses the async function and wait for the async function to complete. only used inside async functions

match: T = ... 
    T is our customized type for object which`s key is string and value is any. 
       import interface T {[key: string]: any}
         


Dynamic Key Integration = it refers to using variables to to define or access property keys in objects. This is useful when we do not know the type of the key in advance. Eg: 
     const sort: T =
      inquiry.order === "productPrice"
        ? { [inquiry.order]: 1 }  //[] inquiry.order is not array but this is a key of object.
        : { [inquiry.order]: -1 };



 const result = await this.productModel
      .aggregate([
        { $match: match },
        { $sort: sort },
        { $skip: (inquiry.page * 1 - 1) * inquiry.limit }, 
        { $limit: inquiry.limit * 1 }, 
      ])
      .exec();






// 75 getProducts
// Promise<Product[]> "async => Promise, product of array => Product[]

// 76-77 develop getMyOrders updateOrder rest API
// verifyAuth = always ask req, no next step
// retrieveAuth = no need to be logged user, if it is a logged user then makes req=user, also  otherwise also shows next step
// Inside an Pending object all execution occurs at the same time.
// Pending Object it waits till an action completes inside an object
// Promise.all => We cannot use iterative function(for, for-each) with async conditions\. So we use an Promise.all
// POST has header and body
// T-type is any, our choice/ T is used to get Object value of any. T {key: string, value: any}
// Number (capital letter): to convert eg: page: Number(page)
// number (lowercase letter): ts related eg: memberPoints: number

Hooks - useState and useEffect React Hooks
React Functional components - any function used in react, for components we use function not class in react
Hooks are functions in React that let you use state and other React features in functional components, without needing class components. It allows to catch changes in operations
to use states we use use-state hook
to use life cycle methods we use use-effect
State in React is a built-in object that is used to contain data or information about the component. State can change over time, and when it does, the component re-renders
Lifecycle Methods in React are special methods that get called at different stages of a component's life, such as when it is created, updated, or removed from the DOM.
In functional components, these lifecycle methods can be managed using the useEffect hook.
useEffect hook has 2 arg 1. CallBack function 2. array dependency eg:

 useEffect(() => {
    console.log("ComponentDidMount"); // DATA Fetch
}, [array]);  //empty array => function only works once. if it has value and when value changes it also changes

 useState
When you call useState, it returns an array with two elements:
Current State Value: The current value of the state.
Setter Function: A function to update the state.

const [value, setValue] = useState<boolean>(true);
  // useState hook returns 2 values in array 1. value its type is boolean, with initial value true. 2.setValue function to update value 
  [] are used for array destructuring.

  destructuring allows to unpack values from arrays and object into variables
  eg: const [a, b] = [1, 2] =>array d.
  const {name, age} = {name: ALice, age: 25}
  

dependency array is an array of values that the effect or memoized value depends on.

//@ts-nocheck => do not check ( at the beginning react file)
in react classes has use-state but functions do not so we use hooks to use use-state in functions
React component lifecycle methods:
1. Mounting (create)
   - constructor
   - static getDerivedStateFromProps
   - render
 + - componentDidMount
2. Updating (update)
   - static getDerivedStateFromProps
   - shouldComponentUpdate
   - render
   - getSnapshotBeforeUpdate
 + - componentDidUpdate
3. Unmounting (remove)
 + - componentWillUnmount
in short(devex)
1. Mounting (create) => componentDidMount (when a certain component is mounted, it works)
2. Updating (update) => componentDidUpdate()
3. Unmounting (remove) => componentWillUnmount
eg:

  useEffect(() => {
    console.log("ComponentDidMount", count); // 1. ComponentDidMount
    setCount(count + 1);
    return () => { // 3. ComponentWillUnmount
      console.log("ComponentWillUnmount");
    };
  }, [value]); // => 2. ComponentDidUpdate

Webpage: What you see rendered in your browser, including text, images, and other content.
DOM: The representation of the webpage's structure that your browser creates from the HTML document. It includes elements, attributes, and text as nodes in a tree structure.

/*  79 Redux
Plans:
- Review run of project
- Learn Redux architecture of our project
- Pros of Redux Toolkit

Review run of project
  - run (yarn run build) to compile our project
  - but, in the end of ts changes to js
  - if we type 'yarn run dev' it builds 'build' folder
        - build folder transfers all files in the development process of the project in ts or any to a js file to run them in production
  - yarn global add serve
  - serve -s build
  - yarn global add serve- 
       - Local:   http://localhost:3000 
       - Network:  http://192.168.1.234:3000 

Learn Redux architecture of our project
  - library but most famous when its is used with react 
  - Redux is based on Flux architecture
  1. Vie/UI
  2. Action = Action Creator + Action Type 
  3. Reducer
  4. Store

  Additional Concept
    1. dispatch(so called 'slice') => Sends actions to the store to update the state.
      Action => Reducer 
    2. subscribe(so called 'selector') => Listens for state changes in the store. 
      Reducer => Store => View/UI

  - Follows the unidirectional data flow => one orderly direction
  - MVC we can use it for both front and backend, but no store
  - Redux, mostly or only used for frontend with react and other libraries. It has one store(storage)
  - MVC. Controllers handle entire logic
  - Redux. Reducer handle entire logic Action => Reducer => Store => View/UI
  - Debugging is the process of finding and fixing errors or bugs in the source code of any software.
    easier in Redux than MVC
  - Storage is open to all components

Pros of Redux Toolkit
  - Redux Toolkit makes it easier to write good Redux applications and speeds up development,
